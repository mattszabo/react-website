# react-website
This was my first attempt at a **react** app. It's a basic single page app without any real content. It attempts to emulate a bootstrap style navbar and uses React Routing to display different content.

It also makes use of some ES6+ code transpiled with babel, and a webpack config for both dev (with mot module replacement) and prod builds.

## installation
```git clone https://github.com/wekilledit/react-website.git .```
```cd react-website```
```npm install```

## running dev
```npm start```

## prod build
```npm run build```
