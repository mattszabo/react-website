# react-website
This was my first attempt at a **react** app. It's a basic single page app without any real content. It attempts to emulate a bootstrap style navbar and uses React Routing to display different content.

It also makes use of some ES6+ code transpiled with babel, and a webpack config for both dev (with mot module replacement) and prod builds.

## installation
npm install

## running dev
npm start

## prod build
npm run build
